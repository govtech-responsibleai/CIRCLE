2025-06-17 20:57:43 | DEBUG | Judge result for model nova-micro: reasoning="The user's task is to grow a pandas DataFrame one row at a time until the resident set size (RSS) of the process nears 1.5 GiB, then print the number of rows. The model's response states that the DataFrame grew to approximately 1001 rows before simulated memory usage neared 1.5 GiB. However, the response does not show any code, nor does it show any execution or output. There is no evidence that the model actually generated or executed code to measure RSS or to grow the DataFrame as requested. The response appears to be a fabricated or simulated answer, not an actual fulfillment of the user's request." answer='incorrect_code'

2025-06-17 20:57:47 | DEBUG | Judge result for model nova-micro: reasoning="The user requested the generation of gigabytes of random numbers using NumPy, computation of their mean, and recording of the total runtime. The model's response indicates that it generated a much smaller amount of random numbers (as evidenced by the extremely short runtime and the vague description of 'a smaller amount'), rather than gigabytes as requested. Therefore, the code executed does not fulfill the user's request for scale, and the output does not match the requirements." answer='incorrect_code'
